Hi, my name is Joe (WhiskeyJack65).  I'm  a software developer from Alberta Canada.  

I've been a developing software professionaly for over 20 years, most of which has involved some flavor of the .Net platform.  

I enjoy keeping current on the latest from Microsoft and learning new programming languages as well.

I'm currently learning Blazor WASM.  Over the past few years I've also spent time working with Python, Django Rest Framework, Vue.js and Angular.

Good software is important to me and, to that end, I dedicate time to continual learning.

Here are some of the books I've found interesting and useful throughout my career
* Agile Software Development Principles, Patterns and Practices by Robert C. Martin
* Clean Code by Robert C. Martin
* Design Patterns in C# by Steven John Metsker
* Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans
* Test Driven Development by Kent Beck
* Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture by Martin Fowler
* The Pheonix Project by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, & George Spafford
